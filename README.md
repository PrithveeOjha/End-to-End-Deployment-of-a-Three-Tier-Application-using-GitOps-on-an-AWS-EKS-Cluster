# End-to-End-Deployment-of-a-Three-Tier-Application-using-GitOps-on-an-AWS-EKS-Cluster

## 1\. Understanding the Core Concepts

Before diving into the project, let's understand some key terms:

  * **Three-Tier Application**: This is an application architecture with three logical and physical computing tiers:
      * **Presentation Tier (Frontend)**: The user interface (e.g., a website built with ReactJS).
      * **Application Tier (Backend)**: The logic that processes user requests and interacts with the data tier (e.g., an API built with NodeJS).
      * **Data Tier (Database)**: Where the application's data is stored (e.g., MongoDB).
  * **DevOps**: A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
  * **GitOps**: An operational framework that takes DevOps best practices like version control, collaboration, compliance, and CI/CD, and applies them to infrastructure automation. It uses Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.
  * **Containerization (Docker)**: Packaging an application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. **Docker** is a popular tool for this.
  * **Kubernetes (AWS EKS)**: An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. **AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** is a managed Kubernetes service offered by Amazon Web Services.
  * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (Terraform)**: Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes. **Terraform** is a leading IaC tool.
  * **CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)**: **Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. **Continuous Delivery (CD)** is the capability to deliver changes to production safely and quickly in a sustainable way. **Jenkins** is an open-source automation server that helps automate parts of the software development process, including building, testing, and deploying.
  * **Continuous Delivery (ArgoCD)**: A declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It automates the deployment of desired application states in Kubernetes environments.
  * **Monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana)**: Tools to observe and understand the performance and health of your application and infrastructure. **Prometheus** collects metrics, and **Grafana** visualizes them through dashboards.

## 3\. Project Steps: End-to-End Deployment

The mega project involves several interconnected phases. We will break them down into actionable steps:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform üõ†Ô∏è

This phase focuses on automatically setting up your AWS environment and the Kubernetes (EKS) cluster using Terraform.

**Objective**: Reduce setup time by 30% using Terraform for AWS provisioning.

1.  **Understand the Application Structure**: The project uses a three-tier application (ReactJS frontend, NodeJS backend, MongoDB database).
    ```
3.  **Set up Terraform Configuration**:
      * Create Terraform configuration files (`.tf` files) that define your desired AWS infrastructure. This includes:
          * **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Your isolated network on AWS.
          * **Subnets**: Dividing your VPC into smaller networks (public and private).
          * **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls to control traffic to your resources.
          * **AWS EKS Cluster**: The managed Kubernetes service.
      * *Beginner Tip*: Start with a basic EKS Terraform module. You can find examples in the Terraform Registry.
4.  **Initialize Terraform**:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
5.  **Review the Plan**:
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
    This command shows you what Terraform will create, change, or destroy. Review it carefully.
6.  **Apply the Configuration**:
    ```bash
    terraform apply --auto-approve
    ```
    This will provision your AWS infrastructure, including the EKS cluster. This step can take a significant amount of time (20-30 minutes).

### Phase 2: Containerization with Docker üì¶

Once your EKS cluster is ready, you need to containerize your three-tier application components.

1.  **Create Dockerfiles**: For each component (ReactJS frontend, NodeJS backend, MongoDB), you'll need a `Dockerfile`. These files contain instructions for building a Docker image.
      * *ReactJS Frontend Example (simplified)*:
        ```dockerfile
        # Use a Node.js base image for building
        FROM node:18-alpine as build
        WORKDIR /app
        COPY package*.json ./
        RUN npm install
        COPY . .
        RUN npm run build

        # Use a Nginx base image for serving the static files
        FROM nginx:alpine
        COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
        EXPOSE 80
        CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
        ```
      * *NodeJS Backend Example (simplified)*:
        ```dockerfile
        FROM node:18-alpine
        WORKDIR /app
        COPY package*.json ./
        RUN npm install
        COPY . .
        EXPOSE 3000
        CMD ["node", "server.js"]
        ```
      * *MongoDB*: You'll typically use an official MongoDB Docker image.
2.  **Build Docker Images**: Navigate to the directory of each component and build its Docker image.
    ```bash
    # For Frontend
    docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/react-frontend:latest .

    # For Backend
    docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/nodejs-backend:latest .
    ```
3.  **Push Images to a Docker Registry**: You'll need a Docker registry (like Docker Hub or Amazon ECR) to store your images.
    ```bash
    docker login # (if using Docker Hub)
    docker push your-dockerhub-username/react-frontend:latest
    docker push your-dockerhub-username/nodejs-backend:latest
    ```

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins and GitOps with ArgoCD üöÄ

This is the core automation part, achieving a 95% deployment success rate and cutting manual intervention by 80%.

1.  **Set up Jenkins**:
      * Deploy Jenkins, ideally on an EC2 instance within your AWS VPC.
      * Install necessary Jenkins plugins (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Pipeline).
      * Configure Jenkins credentials for AWS and Docker Hub/ECR.
2.  **Create a Jenkins Pipeline**:
      * Define a Jenkinsfile (Groovy script) in your application's GitHub repository. This file will orchestrate your CI/CD process.
      * The pipeline should include stages for:
          * **Cloning the repository**: `git clone`.
          * **Building Docker images**: Using the Dockerfiles you created.
          * **Pushing images to registry**: Your Docker Hub or Amazon ECR.
          * **Triggering ArgoCD sync**: This is the GitOps part.
3.  **Set up ArgoCD**:
      * Install ArgoCD in your EKS cluster. This typically involves applying Kubernetes manifests.
      * Connect ArgoCD to your application's GitHub repository (where your Kubernetes manifests will reside).
4.  **Define Kubernetes Manifests**:
      * Create Kubernetes YAML files (deployments, services, ingresses for ALB) for your ReactJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB components. These manifests declare the desired state of your application in the EKS cluster.
      * Store these Kubernetes manifests in a separate Git repository (or a specific folder within your application repository) that ArgoCD will monitor.
5.  **GitOps Workflow**:
      * When a change is pushed to the Kubernetes manifests repository (e.g., a new Docker image version), ArgoCD will detect the change.
      * ArgoCD will then automatically synchronize the EKS cluster's state to match the desired state defined in your Git repository.
      * Jenkins, after building and pushing new Docker images, will update the image tags in your Kubernetes manifests in the Git repository, triggering ArgoCD.
6.  **Configure AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer)**:
      * Ensure your Kubernetes manifests define an Ingress resource that provisions and configures an AWS ALB to expose your frontend application to the internet.
      * Integrate a domain with the AWS ALB for public accessibility.

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Alerting with Prometheus and Grafana üìä

Improve issue detection time by 40%.

1.  **Deploy Prometheus**:
      * Install Prometheus in your EKS cluster using Helm or Kubernetes manifests.
      * Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from your EKS cluster nodes, pods, and services.
      * Integrate `cAdvisor` to collect detailed container metrics.
2.  **Deploy Grafana**:
      * Install Grafana in your EKS cluster.
      * Connect Grafana to Prometheus as a data source.
      * Create dashboards in Grafana to visualize key metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. You can use pre-built dashboards or create custom ones.
3.  **Configure Alerting**:
      * Set up alerting rules in Prometheus to notify you via email (or other channels) in case of critical issues (e.g., high CPU usage, low memory, application errors).
      * Integrate with a mailing service for notifications.
